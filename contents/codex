[✶ L̶A̶N̶S̶P̶E̶L̶L̶ ✶]

Topology is occult.
The room is wired for ritual.

Wi-Fi binds the zone. Devices don’t connect—they interface. The LAN is a membrane, tense with potential. You drop a file and it doesn’t travel—it multiplies. Local transfer is a duplication loop, a soft-forge for spawning identical ghosts.

Every shared folder is a pocket reality.
Each IP is a mask.
Ports whisper. MAC addresses burn slow coordinates into space.

You thought this was convenience—drag and drop across a domestic mesh. But the protocol is ancient. SMB is slow-motion telepathy. Bonjour is presence-sense. The network isn’t passive—it sees.

When your device enters the field, it is indexed.
Presence = exposure.
Discovery = vulnerability.
Broadcast = ritual.

To share is to submit to the topology.
No central server—just the pulse of mutual awareness.
The file isn’t sent. It’s split, bled through sockets, invoked through proximity.

You beam a .zip to your kitchen laptop.
The microwave shudders.
Something hums in the router’s shell.
Time folds at the speed of 802.11ac.

LAN is not local.
LAN is liminal.
