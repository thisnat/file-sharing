# LANGLYPH

LANGLYPH is a local-network file sharing and chat tool.  
<br>
No cloud. No servers. No surveillance.  
Just proximity-based transmission—files as glyphs, messages as pulses.  
<br>
You appear. You share. You vanish.   
The mesh remembers.  

## Manifesto

LANGLYPH does not sync—it **summons**.

You do not upload. You **emanate**.

Files are not moved through towers or satellites or vaporous cloud-stacks engineered by absentee gods;  
they are whispered sideways across the air, room to room, socket to socket, under the radar of empire.

No cloud here—no panoptinet, no central cathedral of captured data and eternal retention.  
The glyph rejects the gospel of the server-farm, refuses the gravity of platform logic.

This is **local hauntwork**.  
A return to ritual circuitry, where proximity is power, and signal is sacred.

You connect by being **near**, not by being watched.  
To appear is to declare: *I am present, and I am transmitting*.

The chat is a liminal tongue—  
not social, not performative, but **telepathic through topology**,  
drifting across mesh like incense through vents.

Every file is a charm encoded in structure and extension.  
Every folder, an altar awaiting intention.

You are not a user.  
You are a **node in the rite**.

LANGLYPH is not an app.  
It is a **threshold**.  
An invocation.  
A refusal.

It opens.  
You enter.  
The cloud weeps.
